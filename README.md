# Inactivation of the Human Papillomavirus Using Gene Editing 
## Introduction
From connections to literature in works such as Frankenstein to the controversy surrounding the next generation of super-babies, the implementations of gene editing with the CRISPR-Cas system have permeated our society. But how does the ever elusive CRISPR-Cas system work and in what way can it be realistically implemented? I will be explaining one use of gene editing: inactivation of the human papillomavirus, more commonly known as HPV. This is a simmplified breakdown. For more information, read the original source [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4178730/).
## HPV Background
 E6/E7 gene and what a virus is, how cancer cells work
We will focus specifically on HPV-18, as it is high risk, causing cervical cancers as well as tumors in the genital and throat region. Viability and growth of HPV-18 transduced cells rely on expression of the virus’s E6 and E7 genes. E6 causes degradation of p53: a tumor suppressor while E7 destabilizes the Rb protein, a tumor suppressant; the two prevent cell apoptosis (programmed death to prevent the spread of cancer) and natural aging, respectively. If we can effectively silence the expression of the E6 and E7 gene, there may be a highly effective tool to treat cancer from HPV-18.

## Breaking down CRISPR-Cas
CRISPR: _”Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats”_
- bacterias’ way of transcribing viral DNA for future counter attacks against the same virus

CAS= _“CRISPR associated proteins”_
- an endonuclease, a protein that can cut DNA with molecular scissors
## CRISPR-Cas sgRNA guided endonuclease
Scientists at the Cullen lab adapted tis system from bacteria to humans. In the study, they engineered single guide RNA (sgRNA) to complement the E6 or E7 gene instead of copying the virus’s DNA like bacteria. The cas protein binded with the sgRNA is then introduced to cervical cancer cells. The code and protein work to move to the site of the E6 or E7, and the endonuclease cuts the DNA sequence. The DNA sequence tries to mend itself, but mutations from natural degeneration of the split ends should in theory effectively silence the gene expression. Cell growth then tracked over 10 days.
## Case study results and rebuttals 
Compared to the control group the experimental saw a relatively drastic decrease in survival and growth. It is important to note that most of the population increase can be attributed to cell growth of initially non-transduced cells. The infected cell population decreased tenfold. This can be attributed to the silenced E6 and E7 expression, as it was proven the tumor suppressants p53 and Rb respectively increased compared to control. Additionally, there were no other consistent, unintended alterations in contrast to the consistent results. By tracking the stages of the cell cycle, it could be determined that more cells with threatment were also in earlier growth stages (about 57% of control cells in G1 compared to 77% with genetically altered E6 gene), meaning they did not abnormally pass through cell cycle like normal cancer cells. Intead, they died earlier and prevented further spreading of the cancer.

## Significance of more gene editing research, the future
CRISPR-Cas still under trial to being more precise and thorough to bring the viable cancer cells down to 0, as a tenfold decrease may be even more dangerous for more malignant cancers. Physical removal or death of cancer tissue on a larger scale is currently the most preferred method and ranges from freezing to cone biopsy. With further research, gene editing can save millions with different types of HPV and other diseases.
